# FullstackOpen2022
Fullstack course by Helsinki Open University https://fullstackopen.com

So, we are retaking the journey to become a Fullstack web developer.

For some reason, i've been ending up in this situation several times, i enjoy codding and reading, also the felling of self-improvement. This time i'm just going to enjoy the journey, no crazy deadlines that are not realistic or pushing my self to exahustion, I'm just going to enjoy the time that I can dedicate to this along with my other responsiblities as a father, husband, brother and son.
